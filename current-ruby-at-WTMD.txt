markblackwellme@gmail.com/1FF8FF93: Hello! How are you feeling? :)

Megan: Ok :) What's up?

markblackwellme@gmail.com/1FF8FF93: The file access letters that I was 
suspicious of worked fine on Windows 7 in a simple test I created this 
morning. And, my copy here of the code currently at WTMD looks good, to 
my eyes ("eyeball check"). So to go further, I'll want to include more 
thorough testing. I already have developed such testing, in my current 
code (on Mycroft). To the end of updating WTMD to something like my 
current code, could you, when you have a chance, access the QPlaylist 
computer and write down the complete output of the following Ruby 
version-checking command, for me to see what exactly is running there?: 
ruby -v

markblackwellme@gmail.com/1FF8FF93: and type it in, here?

markblackwellme@gmail.com/1FF8FF93: If you would, please? I'm not in a 
hurry; I'll come back to this chat, sometime later, to read what you've 
typed. Thanks in advance. :)

Megan: ok

Megan: ruby 2.2.4p230 (2015-12-16 revision 53155) [x64-mingw32]

markblackwellme@gmail.com/1FF8FF93: Thanks, dear! :)

Megan: You're welcome :)
